# Python-Challenge
For this project I analyzed two different sets of data using Python. For the first set of Data (PyBank), PyBank, I created a Python script to analyze a set of financial data. 
The script completed the following tasks:

    - Calculate the total number of months in the dataset
    - The net total amount of profits/losses over the dataset
    - The average change in profits/losses over the dataset
    - The greatest increase in profits and the month in which that increase occurred
    - The greatest decrease in profits and the month in which that decrease occurred
    
In the PyBank Folder you will find Resources which contains the original dataset in .CSV form, Analysis which contains a .txt file showing the output of the analysis, and main.py file which contains the Python script. 

For the second set of data (PyPoll), I created a Python script to analyze local polling data. 
The script completed the following tasks:

    - Total number of votes cast
    - Complete list of candidates who had votes
    - Percentage of votes that each candidate received
    - Total number of votes each candidate received
    - The winner of the election based on the total number of votes

In the PyPoll Folder you will find Resources which contains the original dataset in .CSV form, Analysis which contains a .txt file showing the output of the analysis, and main.py file which contains the Python script.
